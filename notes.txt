april 12
commenced the creation of this small django ecommerce project to go along with the flask activities

Created the core app, installed it in settings, then created templates/core to toss index.html which, when combined with the relevant changes to urls.py and views.py, creates the front page of the site!  


moved most of code from index.html to base.html which just plugs into index.html (via an extends keyword), this way code can be reused for more templates. Via the use of some code blocks I added a {welcome |} to the home page tab and a message from base.html into index.html

created a new page for contact info

ixed the format/spacing issue, turns out the tailwind link was improperly set up in quotes, and added a footer with about, contact, privacy policy and terms of use links

added the item app, then created the model and adjusted it to be visible in the admin control panel, also created the first migration and applied it for item

april 14
reviewed some notes about how the django admin panel works

april 15 
finished up getting the item and category visible pn the front page, including images for the items, started work on the item detailed view via detail.html and the relevant edits to views and urls as well as creating a new template folder and details.html for the items app

april 16
made what seemed like progress in item detail, specifically detail.html and the associated urls.py plus views.py for items, but for some reason the image links broke after trying to add related items. Will revisit in morning.

The issue turned out to be the inclusion of item.pk instead of just item in the render of item detail files via views.py, with that fixed everything works as it should and now it's onto sign-ups.
