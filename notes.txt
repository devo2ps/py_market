commenced the creation of this small django ecommerce project to go along with the flask activities

Created the core app, installed it in settings, then created templates/core to toss index.html which, when combined with the relevant changes to urls.py and views.py, creates the front page of the site!  


moved most of code from index.html to base.html which just plugs into index.html (via an extends keyword), this way code can be reused for more templates

created a new page for contact info
